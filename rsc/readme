Modifications of original FSL / Freesurfer files.

All modifications are indicated in the respective files (HKL).


fs/trac-all
-----------
Adapted to work with SunGridEngine. 
Only for use with Tracula Revision 1.35.


fsl/fsl4/fsl_sub_v4
fsl/fsl5/fsl_sub_v5
-------------------
A RAM limit was added to avoid cluster overload.


fsl/fsl5/fsl_sub_v5_patched
---------------------------
RAM limit added & JOB-IDs are written to file for better job control.


fsl/fsl4/featlib_v4.tcl
-----------------------
Cross-modal affine registrations use mutualinfo (rather than corratio) as cost-function. 
Unwarping: +/- y unwarp example files are created.
Only for use with FSL 4.9.1.
  

fsl/FSLNets/nets_glm.m
fsl/FSLNets/nets_load.m
-----------------------
Adapted to work with FSL 4.9.1 and this framework.


fsl/templates
-------------
Added multi-resolution MNI152 templates, the Smith & Beckmann templates and CSF & WM masks.


scripts/dualreg.sh
------------------
i)    sections (mask / dualreg / randomise) can be called separately.
ii)   insert exchangeability block file in randomise call & voxel-wise stats.
iii)  naming of randomise results based on the name of the design used.
iv)   delete ${LOGDIR}/dr[ABCD] cmd-file to avoid accumulation on re-run.
v)    high-pass filtered motion parameters can be used for dr_stage2.
vi)   randomise_parallel or randomise can be used.
vii)  f-tests are considered.


scripts/longt_tbss_2_reg.sh
---------------------------
FLIRT is initialised with transform b0->T1->MNI, where T1 is the unbiased template of the Freesurfer longit. stream,
and b0->T1 is done via Freesurfer's bbregister.


scripts/bin/sort8
-----------------
Allows for natural sort of (version) numbers within text (32bit).


scripts/bin/fslmaths5
---------------------
Allows for filling holes in binary Freesurfer masks (32bit).

-----
Notes.
  The FSL-scripts folder must be exportet and mounted on all nodes.
  "recon-all -use-mritotal" may give better talairach registrations in some cases.
