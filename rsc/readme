scripts/fsl_sub_NOPOSIXLY.sh
scripts/fsl_sub_v5_NOPOSIXLY.sh

POSIXLY_CORRECT variable was commented out to ensure compatibility with recon-all.
JOB-IDs are written to file for better job control.
  

fsl/fsl4/featlib_v4.tcl
------------------
Cross-modal affine registrations use mutualinfo (rather than corratio) as cost-function. 
Unwarping: +/- y unwarp example files are created.
Only for use with FSL 4.9.1.
  

fsl/FSLNets/nets_glm.m
fsl/FSLNets/nets_load.m

-----------
Adapted to work with SunGridEngine. 
Only for use with Tracula Revision 1.35.

  
scripts/longt_tbss_2_reg.sh
---------------------------
FLIRT is initialised with transform b0->T1->MNI, where T1 is the unbiased template of the Freesurfer longit. stream,
and b0->T1 is done via Freesurfer's bbregister.

-----
Notes.
  The FSL-scripts folder must be exportet and mounted on all nodes.
  "recon-all -use-mritotal" may give better talairach registrations in some cases.
