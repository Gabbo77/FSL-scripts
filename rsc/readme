Modifications of original FSL / Freesurfer files.

All modifications are indicated in the respective files (HKL).

fsl/fsl_sub
fsl/fsl_sub_v5
  A RAM limit was added to avoid cluster overload.

scripts/fsl_sub_NOPOSIXLY.sh
scripts/fsl_sub_v5_NOPOSIXLY.sh
  POSIXLY_CORRECT variable was commented out to ensure compatibility with recon-all.
  
fsl/featlib.tcl  
  Cross-modal affine registrations use mutualinfo (rather than corratio) as cost-function. 
  Unwarping: +/- y unwarp example files are created.
  Only for use with FSL 4.9.1.
  
fs/trac-all
  adapted to work with SunGridEngine.
  
scripts/longt_tbss_2_reg.sh
  affine registration is initialised with transform b0->T1->MNI, where T1 is the unbiased template of the Freesurfer longit. stream,
  and b0->T1 is done via Freesurfer's bbregister.
  

Notes.

/FSL-scripts must be exportet and mounted on all nodes
"recon-all -use-mritotal" may give better talairach registrations in some cases
