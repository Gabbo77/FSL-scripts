Modifications of original FSL / Freesurfer files.

All modifications are indicated in the respective files (HKL).

fsl/fsl_sub_v4
fsl/fsl_sub_v5
--------------
A RAM limit was added to avoid cluster overload.


fsl/fsl_sub_v5_patched
----------------------
RAM limit added + JOB-IDs are written to file for better job control.


scripts/fsl_sub_NOPOSIXLY.sh
scripts/fsl_sub_v5_NOPOSIXLY.sh
-------------------------------
POSIXLY_CORRECT variable was commented out to ensure compatibility with recon-all.
  

fsl/featlib_v4.tcl
------------------
Cross-modal affine registrations use mutualinfo (rather than corratio) as cost-function. 
Unwarping: +/- y unwarp example files are created.
Only for use with FSL 4.9.1.
  

fs/trac-all
-----------
Adapted to work with SunGridEngine.

  
scripts/longt_tbss_2_reg.sh
---------------------------
FLIRT is initialised with transform b0->T1->MNI, where T1 is the unbiased template of the Freesurfer longit. stream,
and b0->T1 is done via Freesurfer's bbregister.

-----
Notes.
  /FSL-scripts must be exportet and mounted on all nodes
  "recon-all -use-mritotal" may give better talairach registrations in some cases
