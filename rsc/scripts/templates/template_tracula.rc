# Reinitialize path reconstruction?
# This is an option of last resort, to be used only if one of the reconstructed
# pathway distributions looks like a single curve. This is a sign that the
# initial guess for the pathway was problematic, perhaps due to poor alignment
# between the individual and the atlas. Setting the reinit parameter to 1 and
# rerunning "trac-all -prior" and "trac-all -path", only for the specific
# subjects and pathways that had this problem, will attempt to reconstruct them
# with a different initial guess.
# Default: 0 (do not reinitialize)
